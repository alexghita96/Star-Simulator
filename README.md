# Star-Simulator
C code optimisation coursework for a star simulation program. Includes loop optimisations, vectorisation, and multithreading.

### Compilation
To compile the code, go to the main directory and run the command: **make**. To run the simulation, use **./cs257 N T V** in the same directory, where **N** is the number of stars, **T** is the duration of the simulation, and **V** takes values 0 or 1 to toggle visualisation.
